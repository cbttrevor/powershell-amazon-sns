## Learning Objectives

* In this video, we'll explore how to create an SNS topic and add a subscriber to it.
* We'll use an imperative approach to create the topic (API call #1), and then create a subscription (API call #2).
* We'll connect to a webhook API endpoint, but you can use any of the other supported subscription protocols.
